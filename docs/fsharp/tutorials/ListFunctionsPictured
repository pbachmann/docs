# List functions pictured

## Introduction
Much of F# code will deal with lists (and arrays and seqs). These are done through standard functions provided with F#.

It is extremely important to understand what the list functions do and how they operate differently from one another. This sounds simple enough until you realize there are about a hundred of them.

This page offers a simple, broad overview of the functions and how they differ.

## The situation
Imagine your job is to work with plastic balls. These balls are different sizes and different colours. You start off no balls and usually someone throws the balls at you. F# list functions prescribe what you should do with these balls as they arrive. Sometimes rather than being thrown a ball, you get thrown a grenade (an exception).

You also have a magic wand with which you can produce your own balls.

Your job, at the end of the day, is to produce a result. The result will be one of the incoming balls, or some of them, or a new ball you have created based

## The functions
### Reduce
Someone with a collection of balls throws you the first two. You look at them and throw one away or throw both away and use the magic wand to produce a new one. You repeat the process with the next ball until there are no more balls.
The result is the last ball you have in your hand.
If there are no balls to begin with, you get thrown a grenade.
If there was only one ball to begin with, that is your result and you have no say over the matter.
